# Rate Limit Fixes - Screenshot Extension

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chrome Rate Limiting Error ✅
**Problem**: `MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND` quota exceeded

**Root Cause**: Chrome limits `captureVisibleTab` API calls to prevent abuse. The extension was making too many rapid screenshot requests.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Increased delays**: Added 700ms delay between each screenshot capture
- **Smart fallback**: Automatically switches to visible area capture for large pages (>6 screenshots)
- **Retry logic**: Automatically retries failed captures after rate limit resets
- **User feedback**: Shows warnings for large pages and rate limit issues

### 2. Clipboard Copy Issues ✅
**Problem**: Screenshots not being copied to clipboard

**Root Cause**: Multiple factors:
- `navigator.clipboard` was undefined in background script context (Manifest V3 limitation)
- Rate limiting prevented screenshot capture completion
- Error handling wasn't properly notifying users
- Large pages caused timeouts

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Context Fix**: Moved clipboard operations from background script to content script where Clipboard API is available
- **Direct clipboard access**: Content script now handles clipboard operations directly using `navigator.clipboard.write()`
- **Better error handling**: Proper error messages for HTTPS requirements and permission issues
- **Fallback capture mode**: Added "Quick Capture" for visible area only
- **Enhanced notifications**: Clear success/error messages with helpful troubleshooting info

## New Features Added

### 1. Dual Capture Modes
- **Full Page Capture**: Original functionality with rate limit protection
- **Quick Capture**: Captures only visible area (faster, no rate limits)

### 2. Smart Rate Limit Handling
- Automatically detects when pages are too large
- Falls back to visible area capture to avoid rate limits
- Retries failed captures after appropriate delays

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Two capture buttons in popup:
  - "Capture Full Page" (green) - Original full page functionality
  - "Quick Capture (Visible Area)" (blue) - Fast visible area capture
- Better status messages and error feedback

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (Recommended)
1. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and refresh the extension
2. **Open Any HTTPS Site**: e.g., `https://example.com`
3. **Try Quick Capture**: 
   - Click extension icon
   - Click "Quick Capture (Visible Area)" button
   - Should work immediately without rate limits

### Full Page Test
1. **Small Page**: Try full page capture on a simple page first
2. **Large Page**: Test with the included `test-page.html`
3. **Rate Limit Test**: Try multiple captures in quick succession

### Keyboard Shortcut Test
1. **Default Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+S` (or `Cmd+Shift+S` on Mac)
2. **Should trigger**: Full page capture with automatic fallback if needed

## Expected Behavior

### Quick Capture (Visible Area)
- ✅ **Fast**: Captures immediately, no scrolling
- ✅ **Reliable**: No rate limit issues
- ✅ **Simple**: Single screenshot of current viewport
- ✅ **Clipboard**: Copies to clipboard immediately

### Full Page Capture
- ✅ **Smart**: Automatically falls back to visible area for large pages
- ✅ **Patient**: Waits appropriate delays between captures
- ✅ **Resilient**: Retries on rate limit errors
- ✅ **Informative**: Shows progress and warnings

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Rate Limit Errors?
1. **Use Quick Capture**: Try the blue "Quick Capture" button instead
2. **Wait Between Captures**: Wait 5-10 seconds between full page captures
3. **Reload Page**: Refresh the webpage after extension reload

### Clipboard Still Not Working?
1. **Check HTTPS**: Clipboard API requires secure context (HTTPS)
2. **Try Quick Capture**: More reliable than full page capture
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure clipboard permission is granted

### Extension Not Responding?
1. **Reload Extension**: Refresh in `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Reload Page**: Refresh the webpage you're testing on
3. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in DevTools

## Debug Information

### Console Messages to Look For
- ✅ "Screenshot handler content script loaded"
- ✅ "Starting visible area capture..." (for quick capture)
- ✅ "Starting full page capture..." (for full page)
- ✅ Success notification appears on page

### Common Error Messages
- ⚠️ "Large page detected. Switching to visible area capture..."
- ⚠️ "Rate limit reached. Capturing visible area instead..."
- ❌ "Error: This request exceeds the MAX_CAPTURE_VISIBLE_TAB_CALLS_PER_SECOND quota"

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Failed on large pages due to rate limits
- ❌ No fallback options
- ❌ Poor error handling
- ❌ Confusing user experience

### After Fixes
- ✅ Smart page size detection
- ✅ Automatic fallback to visible area capture
- ✅ Clear user feedback and options
- ✅ Reliable clipboard operations
- ✅ Better error recovery

## Recommendations

### For Best Results
1. **Start with Quick Capture**: Test the blue button first
2. **Use HTTPS Sites**: Better clipboard API support
3. **Small Pages First**: Test full page capture on simple pages
4. **Be Patient**: Allow delays between captures for large pages

### For Development
1. **Monitor Console**: Check both background and content script consoles
2. **Test Rate Limits**: Try rapid captures to verify fallback behavior
3. **Verify Clipboard**: Test paste functionality in image editors

The extension should now work reliably with proper rate limit handling and fallback options!
